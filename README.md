This is a **modernized version** of the classic Pig Dice Game originally developed by [Jonas Schmedtmann](https://pig-game-v2.netlify.app/).
While the original game is designed for two human players,
this updated version adds **AI gameplay**, **dice animations**,
and an improved interactive experience.
